# Explainable 1D-2D Fusion for Fault Diagnosis: A Tri-Level Alignment Approach

## Abstract

Fault diagnosis in rotating machinery has long faced a trade-off between performance and explainability. While 1D time-series methods capture temporal dynamics, they lack frequency domain information; 2D spectrogram approaches provide rich spectral features but sacrifice temporal continuity; and multimodal fusion methods often resort to black-box concatenation without systematic alignment. This paper proposes a novel **Tri-Level Alignment Framework** that integrates 1D temporal signals and 2D time-frequency representations through **physical**, **semantic**, and **geometric** constraints. Our progressive fusion network, incorporating transparent signal operators, achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining complete decision traceability. Extensive experiments on PHM-Vibench datasets demonstrate that our method achieves **95.7% accuracy** while providing quantifiable explainability metrics (faithfulness: 0.89, stability: 0.92, efficiency: 15ms/sample). The three main contributions are: (1) A physics-guided alignment mechanism ensuring cross-modal consistency; (2) A dual-branch architecture with explicit modality contribution analysis; (3) A comprehensive evaluation protocol for explainability in fault diagnosis.

## 1. Introduction

Rotating machinery plays a critical role in modern industrial systems, where unexpected failures can lead to significant economic losses and safety hazards. Data-driven fault diagnosis methods, particularly deep learning approaches, have shown remarkable success in automatically detecting faults from vibration signals [1,2]. However, these methods face a fundamental dilemma: achieving high diagnostic accuracy while maintaining decision transparency.

Existing approaches can be categorized into three main paradigms. **1D time-series methods** [3,4] directly process raw vibration signals, preserving temporal continuity but often missing crucial frequency-domain information. **2D time-frequency approaches** [5,6] transform signals into spectrograms or scalograms, capturing rich spectral features at the cost of temporal resolution. **Multimodal fusion methods** [7,8] attempt to combine both modalities but typically resort to simple feature concatenation without systematic alignment, leading to suboptimal performance and limited interpretability.

The key challenges in developing both high-performing and explainable fault diagnosis systems are threefold: (1) **Alignment**: How to ensure consistent representations across 1D and 2D modalities? (2) **Contribution**: How to quantify each modality's role in the final decision? (3) **Evaluation**: How to systematically assess the explainability of multimodal diagnostics?

To address these challenges, we propose a **Tri-Level Alignment Framework** that systematically aligns 1D temporal and 2D spectral representations through physical constraints, semantic consistency, and geometric preservation. Our **Progressive Fusion Network** (PFN) integrates transparent signal operators (FFT, HT, WF) to maintain interpretability while achieving superior performance.

The main contributions of this paper are:

1. **Tri-Level Alignment Framework**: A novel theoretical foundation for cross-modal alignment that simultaneously enforces physical conservation laws, semantic consistency, and geometric structure preservation.

2. **Explainable Progressive Fusion Network**: A dual-branch architecture with explicit modality contribution analysis, enabling complete traceability of diagnostic decisions.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation Protocol**: A standardized framework for assessing explainability in fault diagnosis, including faithfulness, stability, and efficiency metrics.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work in fault diagnosis and explainable AI. Section 3 details our methodology, including the tri-level alignment framework and progressive fusion network. Section 4 describes experimental setup and datasets. Section 5 presents comprehensive results and analysis. Section 6 discusses implications and limitations. Section 7 concludes the paper.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 1D Time-Series Fault Diagnosis

Early deep learning approaches for fault diagnosis focused on processing raw 1D vibration signals using CNNs and RNNs. Zhang et al. [3] proposed WDCNN with wide first-layer kernels for vibration signal classification. Li et al. [4] introduced attention mechanisms to focus on fault-relevant segments. While these methods preserve temporal information, they lack frequency-domain analysis crucial for fault pattern recognition.

Recent advances include TSPN (Transparent Signal Processing Network) [9], which incorporates interpretable signal processing operators into deep architectures. These methods achieve good interpretability but may miss important spectral features that are highly indicative of certain fault types.

### 2.2 2D Time-Frequency Approaches

Time-frequency analysis has been widely used in fault diagnosis due to its ability to capture both temporal and spectral information. Wang et al. [5] converted vibration signals to spectrograms and used CNNs for classification. Wen et al. [6] proposed LeNet-5 based approach on converted images. More recently, wavelet transform-based methods [10] have shown promise in multi-resolution analysis.

However, 2D approaches suffer from information loss during signal transformation and struggle to maintain temporal continuity. The conversion process also introduces additional computational overhead and may obscure the decision-making process.

### 2.3 Multimodal Fusion Methods

Multimodal learning has gained attention in fault diagnosis for its potential to leverage complementary information. Early fusion methods [7] concatenate features at the input level, while late fusion approaches [8] combine decisions at the output level. Some recent works [11,12] propose attention-based fusion mechanisms.

Despite their success, most fusion methods lack systematic alignment between modalities, leading to suboptimal feature integration and limited interpretability. The contribution of each modality is often unclear, making it difficult to trust the diagnostic decisions.

### 2.4 Explainable AI in Fault Diagnosis

Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important in safety-critical applications like fault diagnosis. Common approaches include attention mechanisms [13], gradient-based attribution methods [14], and prototype learning [15]. Recent work [16] proposed unified evaluation metrics for model explainability.

However, existing XAI methods for fault diagnosis are primarily designed for single-modal inputs and lack standardized evaluation protocols. There is a critical need for explainability assessment frameworks specifically tailored to multimodal fault diagnosis systems.

### 2.5 Gaps and Limitations

Based on the literature review, we identify several critical gaps:

1. **Lack of Systematic Alignment**: Existing multimodal methods do not address cross-modal alignment at a theoretical level.

2. **Limited Explainability**: Most methods provide visual explanations but lack quantitative assessment.

3. **No Standardized Evaluation**: There is no agreed-upon protocol for evaluating explainability in fault diagnosis.

4. **Performance-Transparency Trade-off**: Methods achieving high accuracy often sacrifice interpretability, and vice versa.

Our work addresses these gaps through the tri-level alignment framework and comprehensive explainability evaluation protocol.
